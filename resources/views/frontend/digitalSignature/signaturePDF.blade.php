            Attorney agrees not to take any action that would or may fall outside the power granted herein. The Attorney
            indemnifies the Firm and keeps it indemnified against any loss, damage or expense incurred by the Firm as a result of:
            (i) the Firm acting on instructions of the Attorney that fall outside the power granted herein; or (ii) the Attorney’s breach
            of any term of this Power of Attorney.

        <li>Whether or not the Attorney may use its own discretion when dealing on behalf of the Client under this Power of
            Attorney is a separate matter to be determined between the Attorney and the Client. The Firm shall not be obliged
            to make any enquiry of the Client or the Attorney as to this matter, and the Attorney agrees to act within whatever
            power has been granted by the Client to the Attorney.

        <li>The Attorney acknowledges that the Account and all trades or deals entered into on the Account are governed by the

            make any trades or deals on the personal account.

            incorrect or erroneous instructions submitted by the Attorney that result in a trades or deals that must, for the protection 
            of the Firm or its other Clients or for reasons of market integrity, be reversed.

        <li> The Firm hereby notifies the Client that the Attorney is not an employee, agent or representative of the Firm and further
            that the Attorney does not have any power or authority to act on behalf of the Firm or to bind the Firm in any way.
        </li><br>
        <li>  Unless the Client informs the Firm to the contrary, the Firm may from time to time communicate with the Attorney
            directly regarding the Account. The Client consents to this and the Attorney agrees to pass any such communications
            onto the Client without delay. Communications made by the Firm to the Attorney are deemed to be received by the
            Client at the same time at which they are received by the Attorney.
        </li><br>
        <li>The Client consents to and authorises the Firm to disclose to the Attorney all information that the Firm holds in relation
            to the Account, including personal information that the Firm holds in relation to the Client.

        <li> The Client acknowledges and accepts that, in providing an electronic or online trading system to the Attorney, the Firm
            has the right but not the obligation to set limits, controls, parameters and/or other controls on the Attorney’s ability to
            use such a system. The Client accepts that if the Firm chooses not to place any such limits or controls on the Attorney’s
            trading, or if such limits or controls fail for any reason, the Firm will not exercise oversight or control over instructions
            given by the Attorney and the Client accepts full responsibility and liability for the Attorney’s actions in such
            circumstances.
        </li><br>
        <li>If the Client wishes to revoke or amend this authorisation, it must provide written notice of such intention to the Firm.
            Any such notice shall not be effective until two working days after it is received by the Firm (unless the Firm advises the
            Client that a shorter period will apply). The Client acknowledges that it will remain liable for all instructions given to the
            Firm prior to the revocation/variation being effective, and that it will be responsible for any losses which may arise on
            any trades or deals which are open at such time.
        </li><br>
        <li>The Firm, acting in its absolute discretion, may decide that it will no longer accept instructions from the Attorney in
            relation to the Account. If the Firm does so, it must provide reasonable notice to the Client. The Firm need not specify
            its reasons for no longer accepting instructions from an Attorney, but for the avoidance of doubt such reasons may
            relate to the Attorney’s personal dealings with the Firm, for example but without limitation, if the Attorney owes money
            to the Firm on its own account.
        </li><br>
        <li>The Client understands and confirms that they agree to the Attorneys Fee Schedule, and hereby authorise the Firm to
            deduct the agreed fees directly from the Clients account and send it to the Attorney’s account on a monthly basis,
            between 1st and 10th of every month. The Attorney understands and confirms that such request will be applied only
            under the condition of receiving a written request detailing the profit amount.
        </li><br>
        <li>The Client and The Attorney understand that such payments in the previous clause (14) will not be applied if the margin
            required for the open positions at that time is not sufficient or if the Firm sees that such a request may affect the margin
            required for the open positions, therefore the Firm has the right not to perform the request or to request the closure of
            any/ all open positions.
        </li><br>
        <li>The Client warrants and accepts that if an account number or an indication of a New account is not specified in this
            agreement, this Limited Power of Attorney will apply to all accounts which the Firm holds in the Clients name.
        </li><br>
        <li> This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales
            and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the English courts in relation to any dispute arising out of this
            Limited Power of Attorney.
        </li><br>
        <li>This Limited Power of Attorney may be executed in two counterparts, which together will have the same effect as if the
            Client and Attorney had signed the same document. The Client and/or the Attorney may deliver an executed copy of
            this Deed to the Firm by post or by emailing a scanned copy of the executed Limited Power of Attorney to the Firm, and
            such delivery shall have the same force and effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Limited Power of
            Attorney.
